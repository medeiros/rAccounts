how to: make assets work in production and development
-------------------------------------------------------

both dev server e prod server must see the app as sub-uri '/raccounts'
  you may be able to test locallly as localhost:3000/raccounts
  and you app in production must be in a sub-uri such as www.test.com/raccounts

change the files below:
  /config.ru
    change
      run Rails.application
    to
      map ActionController::Base.config_relative_url_root do
        run Raccounts::Aplication
      end
      map "/" do
        run Raccounts::Application
      end
  /config/application.rb
    add
      config.action_controller.relative_url_root = '/raccounts'

and precompile assets using
  rake assets:clean assets:precompile RAILS_ENV=production
  that way, the sass will be processed and change the image names property (appending the hash).
  without 'RAILS_ENV=production', the assets will be hashed, but the sass files will not reflect the file name changes.

if you css has image-path('mainbg.jpg'), for instance, the output will be '/raccounts/assets/mainbg[hash].jpg'.
